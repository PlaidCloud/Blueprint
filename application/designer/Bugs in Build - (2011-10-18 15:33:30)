Bugs in Build:

CreateCustomWindow jerks when dragged.
FIXED: If you delete a form, then try to move an object from that form, there's an error.
Sometimes, validate fails. Never happens when I use the "Load a Json Document" button.
Sometimes, I need to resize the ACE in the Json Tab before the text becomes visible. I'm pretty sure it happens when I switch tabs before ACE finishes loading.

selection stays after loading a new document
